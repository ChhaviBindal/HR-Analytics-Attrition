The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and drivers behind employee attrition using data analytics and machine learning techniques. 
This enables HR teams to proactively identify at-risk employees and make data-driven retention strategies.

Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing:
-Verified data completeness: No missing or duplicated records.
-Dropped non-informative columns like EmployeeCount, EmployeeNumber, and StandardHours.
-Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding for modeling.
-Created binary label Attrition_Flag for classification (Yes = 1, No = 0).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Calculated Attrition Rate (~16.12% of employees left).
-Analyzed Average Tenure (~7 years) and demographic distribution (age, gender, department).
-Identified high attrition among:
-Younger employees (<35)
-Employees working overtime
-Employees with low job satisfaction or poor work-life balance
3. Feature Engineering:
-Created key variables impacting attrition:
-OverTime, MonthlyIncome
-JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance
-Used visualization tools (bar charts, histograms, KDE plots) to interpret distributions.
4. Multivariate Analysis:
-Generated correlation heatmap to study relationships between features.
-Used pairplots to visually inspect clusters and patterns in the data.
-Found combinations like low income + high overtime = higher attrition risk.
5. Predictive Modeling:
-Applied Logistic Regression on encoded features to classify attrition.
-Achieved ~87% accuracy, with high precision for predicting retained employees.
-Evaluated using metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
6. Business Insights & Recommendations:
-Reduce employee OverTime to avoid burnout.
-Focus on improving Work-Life Balance through HR policies.
-Track and support low-income, low-satisfaction employees.
-Use predictive models to flag high-risk employees and intervene early.

Result:
The model successfully identifies attrition-prone employees using behavioral and performance data. 
This project lays the foundation for data-driven HR retention strategies in real-world organizations.
